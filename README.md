# BrailleAssisstant
BraillEd is a robotic device to help blind and partially sighted people learn braille, by allowing them to enter text via a braille keyboard or voice recognition and learn its corresponding characters on a refreshable braille display. The braille keyboard is supported with auditory feedback to allow users to verify their text. The robot also translates printed material to braille through a fixed camera to understand visual texts.
